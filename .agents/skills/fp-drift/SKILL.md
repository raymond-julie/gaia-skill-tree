  Phase 5 of the feature-pipeline suite. Use this after /fp-iterate prints the
  M4 stop hook confirming CI is green. Fetches origin/main, runs gaia dev diff
  to surface any skill-registry changes the PR introduced that are unrelated to
  its stated purpose (accidental drift), then prints the final pipeline summary.
  Also invoke standalone whenever you want to audit whether a branch has
  unexpected registry drift — e.g. before merging any review/meta or cli/
  branch, or when a reviewer asks "did this PR touch anything it shouldn't?".
  Triggers: "check for drift", "drift check", "final summary", "pipeline done",
  "wrap up the pipeline", "fp-drift", "Phase 5".

# fp-drift  (Phase 5 — Drift Check & Final Summary)

Verify no unintended registry changes leaked into the branch, then close the
pipeline with a human-readable summary. Runs in the main turn — no sub-agent.

## Setup

Read pipeline state:

```bash
STATE=".agents/skills/feature-pipeline/scripts/state.sh"
feature=$($STATE get feature)
branch=$($STATE get branch)
pr=$($STATE get prNumber)
prUrl=$($STATE get prUrl)
issues=$($STATE get issueNumbers)
ciStatus=$($STATE get ciStatus)
```

If `ciStatus` is not `"green"`, stop here — the drift check is only meaningful
once CI has passed, because a failing run may have left the branch in a
partially applied state:

```
⚠ CI is not confirmed green. Run /fp-iterate first, then re-run /fp-drift.
```

## Drift check

Fetch the latest main so the diff is against the true merge base, not a stale
local ref:

```bash
git fetch origin main
gaia dev diff 2>/dev/null || gaia validate
```

`gaia dev diff` compares registry nodes on this branch against `origin/main`.
Any field change, added node, or removed node will appear here. The question
to answer: are ALL changes attributable to the stated purpose of this PR?

**If unexpected drift is detected** (skills or fields changed that have no
connection to `{{feature}}`):

Print a warning table so the user can make an informed call — do not silently
discard or auto-revert the drift:

```
⚠ Skill drift detected — please confirm these changes are intentional:

| Skill ID | Field | Value on main | Value on branch |
|----------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| …        | …     | …             | …               |
```

End your turn and wait. The user may say "intentional", may ask you to revert,
or may open a follow-up PR. Never decide for them.

**If no unexpected drift (or all drift is confirmed intentional):**

Collect the commit list for the summary:

```bash
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
```

Print the final summary and close the pipeline state:
