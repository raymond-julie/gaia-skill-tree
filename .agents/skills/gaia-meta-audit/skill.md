# gaia-meta-audit

Build a prioritized queue of Gaia skills or catalog items that need focused review.

## Workflow

1. Load source surfaces:
   - `registry/gaia.json`
   - `registry/named-skills.json`
   - `registry/named/**`
   - `registry/real-skills.json`
   - `docs/skill_source_contributions.md`
2. Scan for red flags:
   - `promotedNamedSkillId` entries with weak or broad source evidence
   - named skills claiming Ultimate or high-level nodes
   - catalog URLs that point to directories, homepages, or stale paths instead of specific files
   - repo-root evidence where a specific `SKILL.md` or **agent playbook** should exist
   - broad mappings such as an implementation skill mapped to a much larger Gaia capability
   - duplicate or superseded skills from the same source family
   - generated outputs that still reference removed named claims
   - **Likely Fusion Candidates**: Clusters of real-skills or named skills that together suggest a new **Generic (Extra) Name** should be created.
   - **Missing Demerits**: Skills with known heavyweight dependencies or niche integrations that are not yet flagged in the registry.
3. Re-check only enough external evidence to rank candidates. Do not perform every focused audit in the meta pass.
4. Prioritize:
   - P0: unsupported Ultimate/Legendary or named-origin claim
   - P1: wrong `promotedNamedSkillId`, stale source URL, or likely superseded origin
   - P2: broad `mapsToGaia`, duplicate catalog item, or weak evidence tier
   - P3: documentation cleanup or generated-output drift
5. Present a queue with target, reason, suggested action, and source files to inspect.
6. For each accepted candidate, hand off to `/gaia-audit` as a separate focused correction.

## Output

Use this table:

| Priority | Target | Why review | Suggested audit action | Source files |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Stop after the queue unless the user asks to run audits immediately.
