# Gaia Triage Skill

This skill provides a standardized workflow for auditing and pruning issues in the `gaia-skill-tree` repository.

## Workflow

### 1. Issue Management
1.  **Identify Issues**: List open issues using `gh issue list --repo mbtiongson1/gaia-skill-tree`.
2.  **Audit State**: Verify if the issue is already addressed in the current main branch.
3.  **Execute Action**: Update or close the issue via `gh` CLI.

### 2. Repo Hygiene & Guardrails
Before pushing any changes to the registry or code, verify the repository state:

1.  **Documentation Drift**:
    ```bash
    uv run python scripts/build_docs.py --check
    # If stale:
    uv run python scripts/build_docs.py
    ```
2.  **Registry Projections**:
    ```bash
    uv run python scripts/generateProjections.py
    uv run python scripts/exportGexf.py
    ```
3.  **Environment Readiness**:
    Ensure build tools are present for packaging tests:
    ```bash
    uv pip install pytest build setuptools wheel
    ```
4.  **Verification**:
    Run the full suite to catch regressions:
    ```bash
    uv run pytest
    ```

## Evidence Checkpoints

Refer to `references/evidence-check.md` for common file paths and verification commands specific to Gaia.

## Commands

### Post Triage Comment
Use this to update an issue with findings without closing it.
```bash
gh issue comment <issue-number> --repo mbtiongson1/gaia-skill-tree --body "Triage update: <your-findings>"
```

### Close Resolved Issue
Use this when the issue is clearly addressed in the current main branch.
```bash
gh issue close <issue-number> --repo mbtiongson1/gaia-skill-tree --reason completed --comment "Closing as implemented/resolved. Evidence: <summary>"
```

## Tips
- Always check `uv.lock` and `pyproject.toml` for dependency-related issues (#181).
- For documentation drift (#182), run `python scripts/build_docs.py --check`.
- For skill registry issues (#119), check `registry/gaia.json`.
