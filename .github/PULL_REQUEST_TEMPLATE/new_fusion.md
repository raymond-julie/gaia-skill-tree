### Fusion Details
- **Source Skills:** `skillA`, `skillB`, ...

- **Condition:** What must be true for this fusion to activate.

### Rationale
Explain why this combination of source skills should unlock the target skill. Provide evidence or reasoning for the level floor.

### Evidence References
List evidence entries from the target skill that support this specific fusion path:
- `targetSkillId#evidence[0]`
