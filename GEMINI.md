# Gaia AI Agent Skill Registry - Project Context

This file provides critical context and instructions for the Gaia project. Adhere to these guidelines for all development and research tasks.

## Project Overview
Gaia is an open, evidence-backed skill graph for AI agents. It tracks capabilities (Basic, Extra, Ultimate), their evolution (0★ to 6★), and fusion into complex workflows.

- **Primary Technologies:** Python (CLI), Node.js (MCP server, npm wrapper), JSON/YAML (Registry data), Markdown (Skill cards/Docs).
- **Core Concept:** Skills level up through evidence. Tiers: ○ Basic (indivisible), ◇ Extra (combination), ◆ Ultimate (high complexity).
- **Architecture:**
    - `registry/`: Canonical graph (`gaia.json`), named skills, and schemas. **Source of Truth.**
    - `src/gaia_cli/`: Core Python CLI logic.
    - `packages/mcp/`: Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for agent-native integration.
    - `scripts/`: Essential utilities for validation, building, and registry maintenance.
    - `docs/`: Documentation site and generated graph assets.
    - `registry-for-review/`: Intake area for proposed skills (`gaia push`).

## Development Workflows

### Setup
```bash
# Install editable with all extras
pip install -e ".[embeddings,interactive,dev]"

# (Optional) Install npm wrapper for local testing
cd packages/cli-npm && npm install
```

### Key Commands
- **Scan/Appraise:** `gaia scan` (detect skills), `gaia appraise <skillId>` (inspect).
- **Validation:** 
    - `python3 scripts/validate.py` (canonical graph check).
    - `python3 scripts/validate_intake.py` (intake batch check).
- **Documentation:** `gaia docs build` (regenerates site and artifacts).
- **Testing:** `pytest` (Python test suite).
- **MCP Server:** `npx @gaia-registry/mcp-server` (or `node packages/mcp/bin/mcp-server.js`).

### Branch Naming Conventions (Strict)
| Prefix | Scope |
|---|---|
| `schema/` | `registry/schema/` changes only |
| `cli/` | `src/gaia_cli/`, `packages/`, `tests/` |
| `docs/` | `docs/`, `*.md` |
| `review/gaia-push/` | Intake PRs (`registry-for-review/`) |
| `review/meta/` | Registry curation (`registry/` except schema) |
| `infra/` | CI, scripts, `.github/` |

## Technical Guidelines

### Source of Truth
- **NEVER** hand-edit files in `docs/` or generated artifacts like `registry/gaia.svg`.
- **Edit Only:** `registry/gaia.json`, `registry/named/*.json`, or `registry-for-review/skill-batches/*.json`.

### Python Internal Modules
- `src/gaia_cli/formatting.py`: Centralized slash-naming formatters, RANK_COLORS, and tier colors.
- `src/gaia_cli/localContext.py`: Manages `LocalContext`, merging user trees, scan results, and named skill maps.

### Versioning & Pre-commit
- The following files **MUST** be kept in lockstep: `pyproject.toml`, `packages/cli-npm/package.json`, `packages/mcp/package.json`, and `registry/gaia.json`.
- A pre-commit hook (`scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`) enforces this. Do not manually repair version drift without investigation.

### Skill Leveling (Evidence Floor)
- `2★` (Named): ≥ 1 Tier C evidence.
- `3★` (Evolved): ≥ 1 Tier B evidence.
- `4★+` (Hardened/Transcendent): ≥ 1 Tier B/A evidence.
- `6★` (Transcendent ★): Tier A + peer review.

### Coding Style
- **Python:** Follow idiomatic patterns; use `jsonschema` for data validation.
- **Node.js:** TypeScript for the MCP server.
- **Registry:** Skills use `kebab-case` IDs. Display names are Title Case.

### CLI Design Philosophy
- **Local-First Skill Names:** The CLI must prioritize the developer's local workspace context. "Pet names" (e.g. `/gaia-curate` or `gaiabot/gaia-triage`) are considered the *actual*, real skill names for a local developer.
- **Slashes and Colors:** Do NOT remove the slash from local skill IDs. Real/local skill names should be displayed with their slash and colored green to distinguish them from generic canonical concepts. The generic canonical names ("Human Readable Names") are strictly for the state of all skills in the global graph, but developers using the CLI should see their own local skill names.

## Important Files
- `registry/gaia.json`: The core Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of skills.
- `registry/schema/skill.schema.json`: Validation rules for skills.
- `scripts/build_docs.py`: Orchestrates the entire documentation and artifact build process.
- `DESIGN.md`: Visual language and design tokens for the graph and UI.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Detailed contribution workflows.
