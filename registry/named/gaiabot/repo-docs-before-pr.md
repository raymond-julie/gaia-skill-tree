## Overview

Repo Docs Before PR is a repository hygiene skill that enforces docs freshness before opening or reviewing a pull request. It reminds contributors to run the project's local docs drift check, checks whether generated documentation is stale, and asks the agent to stage regenerated files as part of the same change set.

## Notes

This implementation targets repositories that expose a dedicated docs build command. In Gaia, the copyable pre-review check is:

```bash
python scripts/build_docs.py --check
```

If the check reports drift, regenerate with:

```bash
python scripts/build_docs.py
```

The repository reminder workflow surfaces this command on every PR so contributors do not need to infer it from a failed CI log.
