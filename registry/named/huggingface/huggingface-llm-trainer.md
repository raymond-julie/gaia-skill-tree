## Overview

Hugging Face LLM Trainer packages the full cloud fine-tuning path: method selection, dataset validation, hardware and cost planning, Trackio monitoring, Hub authentication, and permanent model persistence. It is broader than generic fine-tuning because it explicitly covers Hugging Face Jobs and modern TRL workflows such as SFT, DPO, GRPO, and reward modeling.

## Origin

Curated from Hugging Face's official `huggingface/skills` repository. This is a named implementation of the `fine-tune` bucket with catalog mappings to ML pipelines and reward modeling.
