## Overview

Grill With Docs is the ultimate domain-aware variant of the design-grilling pattern, fused with the Ubiquitous Language skill. It begins by locating the project's CONTEXT.md and docs/adr/ (supporting both flat and CONTEXT-MAP.md multi-context repos), then conducts a relentless one-question-at-a-time interview.

During the session the agent actively challenges language: when the user uses a term that conflicts with the glossary it calls it out immediately. It cross-references code to catch contradictions between stated intent and actual behaviour. Decisions are written to CONTEXT.md in real time — not batched — using a strict format. ADRs are offered only when a decision is hard-to-reverse, surprising without context, and the result of a genuine trade-off; all three conditions must hold.

By fusing the raw interrogation of `/grill-me` with the domain discipline of `/ubiquitous-language`, this skill serves as the apex of agentic design alignment.
