## Overview

Ubiquitous Language brings Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to the AI agent workflow. The agent scans the conversation and codebase to identify domain-relevant nouns and verbs, proposing a canonical glossary that is persisted to `CONTEXT.md`.

Once established, the agent uses this language as a "source of truth," ensuring that new code, variable names, and architectural decisions align with the business domain. This reduces token waste by eliminating the need for repeated explanations and prevents "software entropy" where jargon diverges from intent.
