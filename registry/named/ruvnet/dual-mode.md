## Overview

Dual Mode is a 3★ fusion of the three dual-mode sub-skills: `dual-spawn` (headless Codex worker launch), `dual-coordinate` (hybrid task routing and workflow management), and `dual-collect` (result harvesting and aggregation). Together they form the complete spawn→coordinate→collect pipeline for running Claude+Codex hybrid workflows. Claude handles interactive reasoning and architecture decisions while Codex workers execute parallelizable implementation tasks in the background.

## Key Capabilities

- **Headless worker spawning**: launches configurable Codex worker pools with shared memory namespaces for background task execution
- **Hybrid workflow coordination**: routes tasks between Claude's interactive reasoning and Codex's parallel execution using three built-in workflow templates
- **Result harvesting**: collects, filters, and aggregates Codex worker outputs with health reporting and multi-format output
- **Spawn→coordinate→collect pipeline**: end-to-end orchestration pattern enabling 3-10x throughput gains on parallelizable workloads

## Origin

First published by @ruvnet as part of the Ruflo orchestration platform. This is the origin implementation for the `dual-mode` skill bucket.

This 3★ fusion unites dual-spawn + dual-coordinate + dual-collect, forming the complete spawn→coordinate→collect hybrid orchestration pipeline.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).

## Installation

This skill is part of the Ruflo orchestration platform.

```bash
npx ruflo@latest init
```

See the [Ruflo (ruvnet/ruflo)](../ruvnet/ruflo.md) capstone for full multi-topology installation options.
